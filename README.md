Every Boiler Engineer Codes - Intermediate Level Programming Assignments in Python

This is an optional 0 credit hour class that I took in the Spring of 2019 so I could start learning Python.
While I fell behind and had to drop the course to focus on classes that went towards my GPA,
I still like to come back to the assignments and try and complete the course on my own time
